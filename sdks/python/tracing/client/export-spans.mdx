title: "process_spans()"
description: "Process collected spans through the processor pipeline."
---

## Signature

```python
process_spans(spans: SpanBuffer | List[ReadableSpan]) -> bool
```

Processes spans through the configured processor pipeline (including the default Respan exporter and any custom processors). Returns `True` on success.

## Example

```python
from respan_tracing import RespanTelemetry, get_client

telemetry = RespanTelemetry(api_key="your-api-key")
client = get_client()

# Collect spans with a buffer
with client.get_span_buffer("trace-xyz") as buffer:
    buffer.create_span("validation", {"result": "pass"})
    buffer.create_span("processing", {"items": 42})
    collected = buffer.get_all_spans()

# Process all collected spans at once
success = client.process_spans(collected)
print(f"Export successful: {success}")
```

<Note>
Use `process_spans()` with spans collected from `get_span_buffer()`. For standard workflows using decorators, spans are exported automatically — you don't need to call this method.
