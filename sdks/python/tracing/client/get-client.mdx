title: "get_client()"
description: "Get the RespanClient for span and trace operations."
---

## Overview

`get_client()` returns a `RespanClient` instance bound to the singleton tracer. Use it inside decorated functions to read trace/span IDs, update the current span, add events, record exceptions, and control export.

```python
from respan_tracing import get_client
```

## Usage

```python
from respan_tracing import RespanTelemetry, get_client, workflow

telemetry = RespanTelemetry(api_key="your-api-key")

@workflow(name="my_workflow")
def my_workflow():
    client = get_client()

    # Read IDs
    trace_id = client.get_current_trace_id()
    span_id = client.get_current_span_id()

    # Update span
    client.update_current_span(
        respan_params={"customer_identifier": "user-123"}
    )

    # Add events
    client.add_event("processing_started", {"items": 10})

    return trace_id

print(my_workflow())
```
